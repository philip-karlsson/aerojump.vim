# aerojump.vim


![Aerojump logo](img/logo.svg?sanitize=true)

Aerojump is a fuzzy-match searcher/jumper for Neovim. Its goal is to enable fast
navigation through searching using the keyboard. It features several modes
which can be used depending on your needs. By using an intelligent scoring
system it will move the cursor to the best match based on your input.

## Demo

### Space mode
![Example Highlight](https://imgur.com/eUYLI3Q.gif)

Quickly move the cursor the line you want to go by typing some letters
present in the line. All other lines are filtered away as you continue typing.

### Bolt mode

Perform a search using fuzzy-matching, results are graded through a scoring system
presenting the most relevant hits first.

### Boring mode

Space mode but unmatched lines are left intact.

## Installation

**Note:** aerojump.vim requires Neovim(latest is recommended) with Python3 enabled.
See [requirements](#requirements) if you aren't sure whether you have this.

```vim
" Install plugin using (in this example using VimPlug)

call plug#begin()

Plug 'philip-karlsson/aerojump.vim', { 'do': ':UpdateRemotePlugins' }

call plug#end()

" Create mappings (with leader)
nmap <Leader>as <Plug>(AerojumpSpace)
nmap <Leader>ab <Plug>(AerojumpBolt)
nmap <Leader>aa <Plug>(AerojumpFromCursorBolt)
nmap <Leader>ad <Plug>(AerojumpDefault) " Boring mode
....

" Or create mappings (without leader)
nmap <space> <Plug>(AerojumpSpace)
```

## Usage

Invoke aerojump in the desired mode. Start typing some characters that matches
where you will go and finish the query by pressing either <Enter> (to go there)
or escape to return to where you were in the buffer before.
